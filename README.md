AFD - this is a simple script that prevents the forensic. 
The script starts after determining the key (your USB).
Before we clone repository

https://github.com/fuckatm/AFD.git

then we connect usb and write in terminal

lsusb

you need to copy uuid of your usb

then we again write

cd afd
sudo nano AFD.sh

you remove *vash uuid usb* and paste your uuid

then you remove *vash konteiner veracrypt* and paste your name of container
